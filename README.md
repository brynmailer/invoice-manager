Invoicing System

Staff need to track time on their mobile phones for billable projects undertaken by the firm. This solution should act in two ways: 1) productivity tracking of employess 2) Invoicing clients for hours spent on project tases 

Build the solution in the following steps:

PROJ1: Maps out the technical details from this general information (you are welcome to copy from above)
UX1: Prototype of time tracking tool, has auth, and a single screen where employess log hours on projects
PROJ2: Pure PHP implementation for frontend, incorporating auth, time tracking and CRUD on all logged tasks 
UX2: Implementation of UX1 using pure html/js and your choice of layout frameowrk
PROJ3: Invoicing interface your choice of a framework for: user management, invoice management, project manangement
PROJ4: Deployment of solution on your choice of hosting platform
UX3: Analysis of the state of the project (including continuous improvments advised to by teacher)

Each item needs approval before the next task can be started.

It is expected that the employee (you) will dogfood your solution, once UX2 has some functionality
